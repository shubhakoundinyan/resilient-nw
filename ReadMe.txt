OVERVIEW:

What is Resiliency? 

Resiliency - A very interesting topic in Computer Networking. The ability to provide uninterrupted and/or acceptable level of service amidst any outages or challenges is termed as "Resilience". Threats and challenges for services can range from simple misconfiguration over large scale natural disasters to targeted attacks. Ensuring the resiliency feature being a foundational feature in the network is a best/standard practice, but what more can one do with resiliency and how can we make it smarter is the real deal!

WHAT DOES THIS PROGRAM DO:

This is a sample program to give a quick demo on resiliency. This network consists of 2 hosts and a default mininet controller.There are 3 networks deployed using the Linux Router Program. When and if there is any interruption even with one of the network (i.e. network outage/network down), the traffic flow will still be successful due to the other 2 existing networks that will signify the resiliency feature.

// The first chunk of this program is a sample SSH program that you can find it on the Mininet website. //
